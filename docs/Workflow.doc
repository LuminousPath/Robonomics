Program flow:

Simulation kicks off a round of business cycles
for each business cycle
firms trade
    each firm looks for raw product
    firms purchase raw product to maximum capacity
firms bid
    if there is a conflict of interest on individual products then firms enter a bidding war
    sort the interested firms by capital value
    richest firms buy first
    if there is additional product, secondary firms can purchase raw product at the same price the richest firm paid
    continue until the list of firms is empty or product is all gone
firms produce
    firms use raw product to create new product
    there exists a function based on net productivity that determines the amount of new product produced
firms create 
    If a firm realizes there is no product within a suitable modicum of acceptance, they may invest a certain % of their capital to create a new firm
    The mother firm may take starting individuals from the unemployment pool to seed the child firmâ€™s ranks
individuals mentor
    a certain percentage of individuals within the firm whose skill sets match the product type most closely must mentor new individuals who start at an initial age
    They may do this via random skill (bit) selection
    They may also do this via crossover
firms manage
    firms may hire individuals
    firms may fire individuals
    individuals above retirement age must disappear from the economy
